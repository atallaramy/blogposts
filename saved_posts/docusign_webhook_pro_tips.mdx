### Here are some tips that makes your docusign webhook implementation more secure and reliable.
- **Use both** HMAC and Basic Authentication for authenticate DocuSign and protect your listener.
- **Always** acknowledge notification messages. If you don't want a message, ignore it, don't reject it. `If you reject it docusign will keep trying sending it again.`
- **Do Not** process messages synchronously. Queue them, then process the queue's messages. Respond to DocuSign within 5 seconds.
- **Application UX:** do not make the user wait for a Connect notification.
- **Use** the Paas architecture instead of opening your firewall, using a DMZ, etc.
- **Do Not** include documents in the Connect payload. It leads to brittle applications. 
- **Be careful** when reading the xml file to ensure you're looking at the right data elements. Eg, there are many "status" elements.
- **Debug** by using a webhook debugging service. Or use logging from your app.
