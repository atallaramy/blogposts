We previously were storing our markdown files on the server. That means every time we add a blogpost we need to re-deploy, and that is not ideal.

- **The first big change** is that we will use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx) files. <span style={{ fontWeight: `lighter` }}>They are more flixable then normal markdown files.</span>  


Here is a code snippit example to be used:
```ts
const sum = (a: number, b: number): number => {return a + b};
console.log(sum(1, 2)) // 3
```
Aslo we can add videos, or images to our blogposts.

*So mdx is really powerful, comparing to markdown.*<br />

- **The second change** here is that we will be pulling mdx files from a separate remote GitHub repo. We will use [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to fetch the files.
- We will create `GitHub` repo for our blogposts. <span style={{ fontWeight: `lighter` }}>As we fetch the blogposts from a repo, we have dynamic content and there is no need to re-deploy.</span><br />
 

- <span style={{ fontWeight: `lighter` }}>We will use GitHub apis because if we do it when unauthorised we have a limit of 60 requests per hour. But if we do it when authorised we have a limit of 5000 requests per hour</span>. So we will use [GitHub OAuth](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) to get authorised.
- We uninstall remark, remark-html and gray-matter packages.
- We rebuild `posts.tsx` file to fetch the posts from github repo.
- We also will use [next-mdx-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-mdx-remote) package to render the mdx files.
    - [Access Frontmatter outside of MDX](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#react-server-components-rsc--nextjs-app-directory-support)
- as an alternative we can use [contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/) package to fetch the mdx files.


- We can use `highlight.js` to highlight the code in the mdx files.
- In combination with `highlight.js` we will use `rehype-highlight plugin` and we're going to pass that to our `compileMDX` function thro the `mdx options`.
- Also we'll use `rehype-slug` plugin to add id's to the heading **start with #**.
- And `rehype-autolink-headings` plugin to add links to the headings.
- **Now we can pass all those dependencies to the `compileMDX` options.**
