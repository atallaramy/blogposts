We previously were storing our markdown files on the server. That means every time we add a blogpost we need to re-deploy, and that is not ideal.

- The first big change is that we will use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx) files. <span style="font-weight: lighter;">They are more flixable then normal markdown files.</span>  
- We will create `GitHub` repo for our blogposts. <span style="font-weight: lighter;">As we fetch the blogposts from a repo, we have dynamic content and there is no need to re-deploy.</span></br>

Here is a code snippit example to be used:
```ts
const sum = (a: number, b: number): number => {return a + b};
console.log(sum(1, 2)) // 3
```
Aslo we can add videos, or images to our blogposts.

## So mdx is really powerful, comparing to markdown.
