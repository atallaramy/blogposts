### How to revalidate data in Next.js?

*Actually this is vey easy to do with Next.js*<br />
*and it can be done in various ways.*

1. Revalidate data schedually every x seconds.
    >`export const revalidate = 10`
2. Revalidate data on every request.
    >`export const revalidate = true`
3. Revalidate intentionally.
    - This will be happen using app/pages/api/revalidate.ts
    - There is a recomnded url to use to request the revalidation.
    - `https://<your-site.com>/api/revalidate?secret=<token>`
    - *In dev mode, we use http not https*
    - *also we can add a path to the url which comes handy if our site is large*
